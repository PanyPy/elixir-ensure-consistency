# EnsureConsistency
A ready-to-use and reference Elixir project template for code consistency, quality, and security.
This template brings together Elixir tools and best practices for ensuring your codebase remains clean, consistent, and maintainable â€” before you even start writing application logic.

It includes:
- Code formatting via mix format.
- Linting & style checks with Credo.
- Static type analysis using Dialyzer.
- Test coverage reports with ExCoveralls.
- Documentation with ExDoc.
- Security auditing via Sobelow.
- Dependency vulnerability check using mix hex.audit.
