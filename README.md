# EnsureConsistency
A ready-to-use and reference Elixir project template for code consistency, quality, and security.
This template brings together Elixir tools and best practices for ensuring your codebase remains clean, consistent, and maintainable â€” before you even start writing application logic.

It includes:
- Code formatting via mix format.
- Linting & style checks with Credo.
- Static type analysis using Dialyzer.
- Test coverage reports with ExCoveralls.
- Documentation with ExDoc.
- Security auditing via Sobelow.
- Dependency vulnerability check using mix hex.audit.


## Getting Started

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ensure_consistency` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```bash
# Clone this repository as a starting point for your new Elixir project:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ensure_consistency.git my_app
cd my_app
mix deps.get
```

## Run All Consistency Checks

Run all quality and consistency checks in one go:
```bash
mix ensure_consistency
```

This project was inspired by concepts from [Adopting Elixir](https://www.google.com.py/books/edition/Adopting_Elixir/aspYEQAAQBAJ) and aims to provide a practical foundation for building maintainable Elixir systems from day one.
